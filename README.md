This project is an image processing application developed in Python that detects the color yellow in real-time using a webcam feed. The program captures video frames, converts them to the HSV color space, and applies a mask to isolate and identify yellow regions. Technologies used include OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and Pillow for additional image manipulation. This project demonstrates proficiency in computer vision, color space transformations, and real-time image processing.

## Technologies Used:

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Pillow
* HSV Color Space
